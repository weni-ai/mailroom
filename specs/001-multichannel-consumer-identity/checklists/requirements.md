# Specification Quality Checklist: Multichannel consumer identity

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-10-07  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- This is a Mailroom **engineering** spec. Product journeys and binding decisions live in the inherited product spec (`c8d007a`). Service and function names here are the HOW.
- Checklist item "no implementation details" is satisfied at the product layer.
- The Consumer graph, attach transaction, and channel webhook parsing are explicitly out of this repository.
- The constitution template does not yet open with the inheritance section. This spec adds that section by hand, as Principle XIII requires.
